Module 9 challenge. As new data engineer at the fictious Pewlett Hackard, I was assigned to research various things about those employeed with the company in the 80s and 90s. I created an ERD to show the varioius tables and their relationships using the QuickCBD tool. Then I was able to perform the various queries as outlined in the challenge.

I would like to acknowlege my instructor and TAs for their guidance in this project: Othmane Benyoucef, Jacob Peroutek, Isabella Taylor as well as classmate Amanda Pigman.
